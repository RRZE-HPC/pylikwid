pylikwid
========

Python interface for the C API of LIKWID
(https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid)

.. image:: https://travis-ci.com/RRZE-HPC/pylikwid.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.com/RRZE-HPC/pylikwid?branch=master

Installation
============

I added a setup.py script for the installation. It builds the C module
and copies it to the proper destination.

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/pylikwid.git
    $ cd pylikwid
    # Build C interface
    # NVIDIA functions enabled by -DLIKWID_NVMON
    $ python setup.py build_ext -I <include path for likwid> -L <library path for likwid> -R <library path for likwid>
    # Install module to the proper location
    $ python setup.py install (--prefix=<where to install>)
    # Testing
    $ python -c "import pylikwid"
    $ ./testlib.py

Functions
=========

After ``import pylikwid`` you can call the following functions:

Marker API
----------

-  ``pylikwid.markerinit()``: Initialize the Marker API of the LIKWID library.
   Must be called previous to all other functions.
-  ``pylikwid.markerthreadinit()``: Add the current thread to the Marker API.
   Since Python is commonly single-threaded simply call it directly
   after ``pylikwid.markerinit()``
-  ``rr = pylikwid.registerregion(regiontag)``: Register a region to the
   Marker API. This is an optional function to reduce the overhead of
   region registration at ``pylikwid.markerstartregion``. If you don't call
   ``pylikwid.registerregion(regiontag)``, the registration is done at
   ``pylikwid.markerstartregion(regiontag)``. On success, 0 is return. If you
   havn't called ``pylikwid.markerinit()``, a negative number is returned.
-  ``err = pylikwid.markerstartregion(regiontag)``: Start measurements under
   the name ``regiontag``. On success, 0 is return. If you havn't called
   ``pylikwid.markerinit()``, a negative number is returned.
-  ``err = pylikwid.markerstopregion(regiontag)``: Stop measurements under the
   name ``regiontag`` again. On success, 0 is return. If you havn't
   called ``pylikwid.markerinit()``, a negative number is returned.
-  ``num_events, events[], time, count = pylikwid.markergetregion(regiontag)``:
   Get the intermediate results of the region identified by
   ``regiontag``. On success, it returns the number of events in the
   current group, a list with all the aggregated event results, the
   measurement time for the region and the number of calls.
-  ``pylikwid.nextgroup()``: Switch to the next event set in a
   round-robin fashion. If you have set only one event set on the
   command line, this function performs no operation.
-  ``pylikwid.markerreset(regiontag)``: Reset the values stored using the region
   name ``regiontag``. On success, 0 is returned.
-  ``pylikwid.markerclose()``: Close the connection to the LIKWID Marker API
   and write out measurement data to file. This file will be evaluated
   by ``likwid-perfctr``.

    pylikwid.markerstartregion("listappend")
    for i in range(0,1000000):
        liste.append(i)
    pylikwid.markerstopregion("listappend")
    nr_events, eventlist, time, count = pylikwid.markergetregion("listappend")
    for i, e in enumerate(eventlist):
        print(i, e)
    pylikwid.markerclose()

This code simply measures the hardware performance counters for
appending 1000000 elements to a list. First the API is initialized with
``likwid.init()`` and ``likwid.threadinit()``. Afterwards it creates an
empty list, starts the measurements with
``likwid.startregion("listappend")`` and executes the appending loop.
When the loop has finished, we stop the measurements again using
``likwid.stopregion("listappend")``. Just for the example, we get the
values inside our script using ``likwid.getregion("listappend")`` and
print out the results. Finally, we close the connection to the LIKWID
Marker API.

You always have to use ``likwid-perfctr`` to program the hardware
performance counters and specify the CPUs that should be measured. Since
Python is commonly single-threaded, the cpu set only contains one entry:
``likwid-perfctr -C 0 -g <EVENTSET> -m <PYTHONSCRIPT>`` This pins the
Python interpreter to CPU 0 and measures ``<EVENTSET>`` for all regions
in the Python script. You can set multiple event sets by adding multiple
``-g <EVENTSET>`` to the command line. Please see the LIKWID page for
further information how to use ``likwid-perfctr``. Link:

Example

Using the above Python script we can measure the L2 to L3 cache data
volume:

At first a header with the current system type and clock is printed.
Afterwards the output of the Python script lists the results of the
measurements we got internally with ``likwid.getregion``. The next
output is the region results evaluated by ``likwid-perfctr`` and prints
at first a headline stating the measured eventset, here ``L3`` and the
region name ``listappend``. Afterwards 2 or 3 tables are printed. At
first some basic information about the region like run time (or better
measurement time) and the number of calls of the region. The next table
contains the raw values for each event in the eventset. These numbers
are similar to the ones we got internally with ``likwid.getregion``. If
you have set an performance group (here ``L3``) instead of a custom
event set, the raw results are derived to commonly used metrics, here
the ``CPI`` (Cycles per instruction, lower is better) and different
bandwidths and data volumes. You can see, that the load bandwidth for
the small loop is 857 MByte/s and the evict (write) bandwidth is 645
MByte/s. In total we have a bandwidth of 1502 MByte/s.

Further comments
================

Please be aware that Python is a high-level language and your simple
code is translated to a lot of Assembly instructions. The ``CPI`` value
is commonly low (=> good) for high-level languages because they have to
perform type-checking and similar stuff that can be executed fast in
comparison to the CPU clock. If you would compare the results to a lower
level language like C or Fortran, the ``CPI`` will be worse for them but
the performance will be higher as no type-checking and transformations
need to be done.
